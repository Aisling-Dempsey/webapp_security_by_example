# Hello Flask

Here are some simple examples of cross-site scripting (XSS) and client-side security using the Flask framework.

They are purposefully minimal examples so the underlying principle is clear, and not obscured by the complexity of a semi-real web app.

## Setup

Install Flask

```bash
# 1. Install Python 3

# 2. Install Flask
pip3 install Flask 

# 3. Run the server
# Note that due to relative pathing this command should be run
# from within this current hello_flask/ directory
python3 hello_flask.py
```

Then navigate in your browser to `http://localhost:5000`.
